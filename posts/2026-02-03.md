# Writing Blog in Markdown with Ada Parser

I have created a simple blog engine/parser in Ada that converts Markdown
files into a static website. Currently, the parser supports basic Markdown
features. Inlines: **bold**, *italic*, ***combination***, `code`, [links](/).
images.

I had ready-made building blocks for creating a static site generator:
* [Markdown parser](https://github.com/AdaCore/markdown) and its HTML convertor, which is used in its tests
* [HTML Writer](https://github.com/AdaCore/vss-extra/blob/main/source/html/vss-html-writers.ads) from the **VSS Extra** library
* [Zope TAL](https://pagetemplates.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tal.html)-style XML [Template Engine](https://github.com/AdaCore/vss-extra/blob/main/source/xml/templates/vss-xml-templates-processors.ads)

All that was left was to put everything together and add the HTML and CSS, which Gemini helped me create.

Currently, VSS doesn't have its own XML parser, and it's needed to store templates.
VSS suggests using a parser from XmlAda or Matreshka, but I didn't want to add these dependencies.
Since the template rarely changes, I 🤡 decided to simply read it using Python, which I already have, and generate Ada code that would return the data that XML Parser would have returned:

```xml
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
```

```ada
procedure Vyasa.Templates.Index
  (CH : in out VSS.XML.Content_Handlers.SAX_Content_Handler'Class;
   Ok : in out Boolean)
is
begin
--  ...
declare
   Attr : VSS.XML.Attributes.Containers.Attributes;
begin
   CH.Start_Element (+"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", "head", Attr, Ok);
end;
CH.Characters (New_Line, Ok);
CH.Characters ("    ", Ok);
declare
   Attr : VSS.XML.Attributes.Containers.Attributes;
begin
   Attr.Insert (+"", "charset", "UTF-8");
   CH.Start_Element (+"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", "meta", Attr, Ok);
end;
--  ...
```

It would be nice to add RSS feed support, commenting capabilities, and syntax coloring, etc.
